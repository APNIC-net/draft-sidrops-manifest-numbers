Abstract

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) makes use of signed
   objects called manifests.  A manifest lists each file that a
   publisher intends to include within an RPKI repository, and can be
   used to detect certain forms of attack against a repository.
   Manifests include a "manifest number" (manifestNumber), which the
   publisher must increment whenever it issues a new manifest, and
   Relying Parties (RPs) are required to verify that a newly-retrieved
   manifest for a given Certification Authority (CA) has a higher
   manifestNumber than the previously-validated manifest.  However, the
   manifestNumber field is 20 octets in length (i.e. not unbounded), and
   no behaviour is specified for when a manifestNumber reaches the
   largest possible value.  This document specifies publisher and RP
   behaviour for this scenario.

1.  Introduction

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480] makes use of
   signed objects [RFC6488] called manifests [RFC9286].  A manifest
   lists each file that a publisher intends to include within an RPKI
   repository [RFC6481], and can be used to detect certain forms of
   attack against a repository.  Manifests include a "manifest number"
   (manifestNumber), which the publisher must increment whenever it
   issues a new manifest, and Relying Parties (RPs) are required to
   verify that a newly-retrieved manifest for a given Certification
   Authority (CA) has a higher manifestNumber than the previously-
   validated manifest (see section 4.2.1 of [RFC9286]).

   However, the manifestNumber field is 20 octets in length (i.e. not
   unbounded), and no behaviour is specified for when a manifestNumber
   reaches the largest possible value, which means that a publisher can
   no longer make use of a given CA certificate when that value is
   reached.  (For the purposes of [RFC9286], a "CA" is represented by a
   CA certificate with a stable location and a stable private key.
   Reissuing a CA certificate with changed resources or a changed expiry
   date does not change the identity of the CA such that the stored
   manifestNumber for the CA is reset, for example.)

   While it is practically impossible for a publisher to reach the
   largest possible value under normal operating conditions (it would
   require that the publisher issue one manifest per second for
   46,343,912,903,694,283,301,740 quintillion years), there is a chance
   that it could be reached due to bugs in the issuance or publication
   systems or incorrect/inadvertent use of those systems.  For example:
   occur:

      Incrementing by large values when issuing manifests, such that the
      time to reach that largest value is reduced.

      Reissuing new manifests in an infinite delay-free loop, such that
      the manifestNumber increases by a large value in a comparatively
      short period of time.

      Inadvertently setting the manifestNumber to the largest possible
      value, such that the publisher will no longer be able to publish
      usable manifests for that repository.

   These scenarios might also arise in combination and be more severe as
   a result: for example, a large manifest number increment bug in
   conjunction with a manifest reissuance loop problem.

   For a subordinate CA, the risks associated with repository
   invalidation due to this problem are low, since the publisher can
   simply use the key rollover process ([RFC6489]) to get a new
   Certification Authority (CA) certificate.  RPs will treat this new
   certificate as though it represents a distinct CA, and the
   manifestNumber can be reset at that point.

   However, this option is not available for RPKI Trust Anchors (TAs).
   If a TA publishes a manifest with the largest-possible manifestNumber
   value, then it is not possible to make use of the TA after that
   point, because the certificate location (stored in the associated
   Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) [RFC8630]) and its private key cannot be
   changed.  Issuing a new TA and distributing the associated TAL to
   clients would involve a large amount of work for TA operators and
   RPs, and there would be a limited degree of RPKI protection by way of
   that TA for the time between the issuance of the problematic manifest
   and the installation of the new TAL for a given client.

   In order to avoid these problems, this document defines how
   publishers and RPs can handle this scenario in order to facilitate
   ongoing use of an affected repository.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

2.  Manifest Number Handling

   For a given CA, an RP MUST NOT reject a new manifest issued by that
   CA on the grounds of it not having a higher manifestNumber than a
   previously validated manifest if the new manifest has a different
   filename from that of the previously validated manifest.  In other
   words, an RP MUST reset its stored manifestNumber for a given CA if
   the CA changes the filename of its manifest.

   With this behaviour, it is possible for a CA to be configured such
   that any time it issues a new manifest, it uses a new filename for
   that manifest.  If a CA were configured in this way, the
   manifestNumber validation set out in section 4.2.1 of [RFC9286] would
   have no purpose.  To avoid this outcome, CAs SHOULD NOT use new
   filenames for manifests except in situations where it is necessary to
   ensure the ongoing validity of the CA or its repository.  Similarly,
   RP software SHOULD alert its operators when a manifest filename
   changes for a given CA.

3.  Operational Considerations

   CA software may opt to support this functionality in various ways.
   For example, it could change the manifest filename when the
   manifestNumber reaches a certain threshold, or it could alert the
   operator in this scenario and request confirmation that the filename
   should be changed.

5.  Implementation status

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort

   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

Appendix A.  Serial Number Arithmetic

   Serial number arithmetic [RFC1982] is an approach that has been used
   in the DNS context (among others) to permit the indefinite use of a
   finite number space.  At least in theory, it would be possible to use
   a similar approach with the manifestNumber field as well.

   However, unlike the corresponding DNS context with SOA resource
   records, an RPKI CA does not have visibility into or control over
   RPKI RPs generally.  This means that it is not possible to select
   updated manifestNumber values or to manage the relevant state
   transitions so as to definitively ensure that all RPs will have valid
   state at the end of the process.  The approach proposed in Section 2
   does not have this problem.
