Abstract

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) makes use of signed
   objects called manifests.  A manifest lists each file that a
   publisher intends to include within an RPKI repository, and can be
   used to detect certain forms of attack against a repository.
   Manifests include a "manifest number" (manifestNumber), which the
   publisher must increment whenever it issues a new manifest, and
   Relying Parties (RPs) are required to verify that a newly-retrieved
   manifest for a given Certification Authority (CA) has a higher
   manifestNumber than the previously-validated manifest.  However, the
   manifestNumber field is 20 octets in length (i.e. not unbounded), and
   no behaviour is specified for when a manifestNumber reaches the
   largest possible value.  This document specifies publisher and RP
   behaviour for this scenario.

1.  Introduction

   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480] makes use of
   signed objects [RFC6488] called manifests [RFC9286].  A manifest
   lists each file that a publisher intends to include within an RPKI
   repository [RFC6481], and can be used to detect certain forms of
   attack against a repository.  Manifests include a "manifest number"
   (manifestNumber), which the publisher must increment whenever it
   issues a new manifest, and Relying Parties (RPs) are required to
   verify that a newly-retrieved manifest for a given Certification
   Authority (CA) has a higher manifestNumber than the previously-
   validated manifest (see section 4.2.1 of [RFC9286]).

   However, the manifestNumber field is 20 octets in length (i.e. not
   unbounded), and no behaviour is specified for when a manifestNumber
   reaches the largest possible value, which means that a publisher can
   no longer make use of a given CA certificate when that value is
   reached.  (For the purposes of [RFC9286], a "CA" is represented by a
   CA certificate with a stable location and a stable private key.
   Reissuing a CA certificate with changed resources or a changed expiry
   date does not change the identity of the CA such that the stored
   manifestNumber for the CA is reset, for example.)

Internet-Draft        RPKI Manifest Number Handling           March 2024


   While it is practically impossible for a publisher to reach the
   largest possible value under normal operating conditions (it would
   require that the publisher issue one manifest per second for
   46,343,912,903,694,283,301,740 quintillion years), there is a chance
   that it could be reached due to bugs in the issuance or publication
   systems or incorrect/inadvertent use of those systems.  For example:
   occur:

      Incrementing by large values when issuing manifests, such that the
      time to reach that largest value is reduced.

      Reissuing new manifests in an infinite delay-free loop, such that
      the manifestNumber increases by a large value in a comparatively
      short period of time.

      Inadvertently setting the manifestNumber to the largest possible
      value, such that the publisher will no longer be able to publish
      usable manifests for that repository.

   These scenarios might also arise in combination and be more severe as
   a result: for example, a large manifest number increment bug in
   conjunction with a manifest reissuance loop problem.

   For a subordinate CA, the risk of repository invalidation due to this
   problem can be addressed by the publisher simply using the key
   rollover process ([RFC6489]) to get a new Certification Authority
   (CA) certificate.  RPs will treat this new certificate as though it
   represents a distinct CA, and the manifestNumber can be reset at that
   point.

   However, this option is not available for RPKI Trust Anchors (TAs).
   If a TA publishes a manifest with the largest-possible manifestNumber
   value, then it is not possible to make use of the TA after that
   point, because the certificate location (stored in the associated
   Trust Anchor Locator (TAL) [RFC8630]) and its private key cannot be
   changed.  Issuing a new TA and distributing the associated TAL to
   clients would involve a large amount of work for TA operators and
   RPs, and there would be a limited degree of RPKI protection by way of
   that TA for the time between the issuance of the problematic manifest
   and the installation of the new TAL for a given client.

   In order to avoid these problems, this document defines how
   publishers and RPs can handle this scenario in order to facilitate
   ongoing use of an affected repository.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] [RFC8174].

2.  Manifest Number Handling

   For a given CA, an RP MUST NOT reject a new manifest issued by that
   CA on the grounds of it not having a higher manifestNumber than a
   previously validated manifest if the new manifest has a different
   filename from that of the previously validated manifest.  In other
   words, an RP MUST reset its stored manifestNumber for a given CA if
   the CA changes the filename of its manifest.

   With this behaviour, it is possible for a CA to be configured such
   that any time it issues a new manifest, it uses a new filename for
   that manifest.  If a CA were configured in this way, the
   manifestNumber validation set out in section 4.2.1 of [RFC9286] would
   have no purpose.  To avoid this outcome, CAs SHOULD NOT use new
   filenames for manifests except in situations where it is necessary to
   ensure the ongoing validity of the CA or its repository.  Similarly,
   RP software SHOULD alert its operators when a manifest filename
   changes for a given CA.

   Note that this approach is different from that described in
   Section 3.2.1 of [RFC8488].

3.  Operational Considerations

   CA software may opt to support this functionality in various ways.
   For example, it could change the manifest filename when the
   manifestNumber reaches a certain threshold, or it could alert the
   operator in this scenario and request confirmation that the filename
   should be changed.

Appendix A.  Serial Number Arithmetic

   Serial number arithmetic [RFC1982] is an approach that has been used
   in the DNS context (among others) to permit the indefinite use of a
   finite number space.  At least in theory, it would be possible to use
   a similar approach with the manifestNumber field as well.

   However, unlike the corresponding DNS context with SOA resource
   records, an RPKI CA does not have visibility into or control over
   RPKI RPs generally.  This means that it is not possible to select
   updated manifestNumber values or to manage the relevant state
   transitions so as to definitively ensure that all RPs will have valid
   state at the end of the process.  The approach proposed in Section 2
   does not have this problem.

Appendix B.  Walkthrough of the rpki-client implementation

   This section describes the [rpki-client] implementation with regard
   to handling manifest numbers.  The process is composed of multiple
   stages:

   1.  Fetching the manifests and acquiring referenced files

   2.  Preprocessing of the manifests

   3.  Selecting the first candidate manifest

   4.  Matching file names and hashes

   5.  Optionally selecting the second candidate manifest

B.1.  Stage: Fetching the Manifests and Acquiring Referenced Files

   The RP follows _rpkiNotify_ or _caRepository_ pointers in the
   _SubjectInfoAccess_ extension of valid CA certificates to queue up
   synchronization tasks.

   At the end of this stage the RP has zero, one, or two manifests for a
   given _caRepository_. Depending on the validation status, the RP
   stores files into two locations: _DIR_VALID_ or _DIR_TEMP_.
   _DIR_VALID_ contains objects which were found to be valid (current,
   not revoked, not expired) during the previous validation run, the
   _DIR_TEMP_ location contains files retrieved via RRDP or rsync which
   have not yet been validated, or were rejected by the validation
   process.

   If the remote publication point is unreachable on both RRDP and
   rsync, no purported "new" manifest file will be stored in _DIR_TEMP_.
   It is possible that the _DIR_VALID_ location contains a locally
   cached version of the object from a previous validation run.

Internet-Draft        RPKI Manifest Number Handling           March 2024


B.2.  Stage: preprocessing of the manifests

   Constructing the path and filename based on the _rpkiManifest_ of the
   CA certificate, the RP attempts to open what purportedly are two
   version of the same _.mft_ file in _DIR_TEMP_ and _DIR_VALID_,
   respectively.

   For brevity's sake, the version in _DIR_TEMP_ is associated with a
   data structure named *mft1*, the version in _DIR_VALID_ is associated
   with a data structure named *mft2*.

   Assuming two files exist in the _DIR_TEMP_ and _DIR_VALID_ locations,
   both files are run through a series of checks.  If any check fails,
   that file will be considered ineligible.

   1.   Can the file be opened?

   2.   Can the content of the file be DER-decoded

   3.   Can the DER-content be parsed as CMS ContentInfo?

   4.   Is the CMS self-signage correct?

   5.   Can exactly one CMS SignerInfo be extracted?

   6.   Is the ContentInfo of the right version?

   7.   Is the SignerInfo of the right version?

   8.   Does the SignerInfo have the correct signed attributes?

   9.   Does the SignerInfo have the correct digest and signature
        algorithms?

   10.  Does the ContentInfo have the right type of embedded content?

   11.  Does the eContentType match the Content-Type?

   12.  Does the CMS contain zero CRLs?

   13.  Can exactly one X.509 cert be extracted from the SignerInfo?

   14.  Can the notBefore field be extracted from the X.509 cert?

   15.  Can the notAfter field be extracted from the X.509 cert?

   16.  Does the X.509 cert's SKI match the SignerInfo's
        SignerIdentifier?

Internet-Draft        RPKI Manifest Number Handling           March 2024


   17.  Can the AIA be extracted from the X.509 EE?

   18.  Can the AKI be extracted from the X.509 EE?

   19.  Can the SIA be extracted from the X.509 EE?

   20.  Can the SKI be extracted from the X.509 EE?

   21.  Are the X509 EE's RFC 3779 extensions set to inherit?

   22.  Can the eContent be parsed according to the ASN.1 formal syntax?

   23.  Is the Manifest eContent of the right version?

   24.  Can the manifestNumber be extracted?

   25.  Is the CMS signing-time before the Manifest nextUpdate time?

   26.  Is 'now' not before the Manifest thisUpdate?

   27.  Is 'now' not after the Manifest nextUpdate?

   28.  Is the Manifest nextUpdate not before the Manifest thisUpdate?

   29.  Does a valid certification path from a TA to this EE cert exist?

   Through the above checks, the *mft1* and *mft2* data structures are
   populated, or marked ineligible.

B.3.  Stage: selecting the first candidate manifest

   Assuming both *mft1* and *mft2* successfully passed through stage 2
   (Appendix B.2), a comparison can be made between *mft1* and *mft2* to
   select the candidate mft for the next stage.

   The RP checks whether the locally cached version *mft2* (from
   _DIR_VALID_) is older in the sense that was issued earlier than
   *mft1* (from _DIR_TEMP_) by comparing the Manifest _thisUpdate_
   timestamp, and has a smaller _manifestNumber_. If both conditions are
   true, the RP will select *mft1* as candidate for stage stage 4
   (Appendix B.4).

   If there was some kind of issue with *mft1*(such as it being older
   than or has the same _thisUpdate_ as *mft2*, or it having a
   _manifestNumber_ which is lower than or equal to *mft2*), the RP
   proceeds with stage 5 (Appendix B.5).

Internet-Draft        RPKI Manifest Number Handling           March 2024


B.4.  Stage: matching file names and hashes for mft1

   The RP will now verify the hash value of each file listed in manifest
   *mft1* matches the value obtained by hashing the file acquired from
   the publication point.  If the computed hash value of a file listed
   on the manifest does not match the hash value contained in the
   manifest, then a _failed fetch_ occurred and the RP proceeds to stage
   5 (Appendix B.5).

   If all the files and hashes matched, *mft1* and its associated files
   are moved from _DIR_TEMP_ to _DIR_VALID_. The manifest handling
   procedure now ends.

B.5.  Optional Stage: matching file names and hashes for mft2

   This stage is only reached if there was an issue with *mft1*.

   The RP will now verify the hash value of each file listed in manifest
   *mft2* matches the value obtained by hashing the file acquired from
   the publication point.  If the computed hash value of a file listed
   on the manifest does not match the hash value contained in the
   manifest, then the _caRepository_ is busted.
